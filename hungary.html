                      <p class="word-spacing">Bars are one of Budapest's highlights. The city has many bars, restaurants, and clubs close to one other, and most importantly, it is secure. This is from the "Ruins" bar. The building was in ruins; there were old tables and chairs, and walls with people's scrawled expressions. This old-school, vintage bar has a great vibe, great prices, and nice folks. I had a great day and suggest it to anybody who likes vintageÂ bars.</p>

It is the largest synagogue in Europe, seating 3,000 people, and is a center of Neolog Judaism. I liked the architecture of the building, and it caught my attention every time I passed it. I also like this picture I took; symmetry and lights look pretty cool.</p>

I always knew that Budapest is an alive and vibrant city, but I understood it when I visited it. The city is always awake and ready to explore what Hungarian culture provides. One of the buildings that I like is the Parliament, which is enormous and beautiful. In front of the building, there is a statue of a kossuth memorial. It is an official symbol of Hungarian culture. <a style = "color:black" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEQJpzKqd9I"> Click here to watch the video </a>  <p>
