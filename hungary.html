It is the largest synagogue in Europe, seating 3,000 people, and is a center of Neolog Judaism. I liked the architecture of the building, and it caught my attention every time I passed it. I also like this picture I took; symmetry and lights look pretty cool.</p>

The city is packed with bars, restaurants, and clubs which are not too far from each other and most importantly, you can feel safe there. This picture is from the bar which is called "Ruins." It fits the context of ruins because the building was kind of ruined; there were old tables and chairs, walls were all written up by people from different generations. However, the thing that was not ruined was the vibe. This old-school, vintage place had a fantastic atmosphere, super cheap drinks, and friendly people. I had a lot of fun there, and I recommend it to everyone who loves vintage-style bars.</p>

My trip to Hungary Budapest was unexpected, and that is why it was fun there. I always knew that Budapest is an alive and vibrant city, but I understood it when I visited it. The city is always awake and ready to explore what Hungarian culture provides. One of the buildings that I like is the Parliament, which is enormous and beautiful. In front of the building, there is a statue of a kossuth memorial. It is an official symbol of Hungarian culture.  <p>
