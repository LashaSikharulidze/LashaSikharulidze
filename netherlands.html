                  <p class="word-spacing">After visiting the Netherlands, Amsterdam in particular, I was left speechless. The whole city felt like heaven; the people, architecture, food, and atmosphere were on another level. This picture shows one of the bridges I came across and is stunning. Those little bridges with flowers and different decorations light the city up. Overall, my experience in the Netherlands was outstanding, and my goal is to return there sometime in the future. </p>

                    <p class="word-spacing">Talking about Amsterdam as a stunning city, I should mention its excellent museums and theatres. I am emphasizing here is Madame Tussaud, a wax museum where you see celebrities figures all around the world. I had a lot of fun during the exhibition with my friend. This museum is cool and defiantly worth visiting.</p>
