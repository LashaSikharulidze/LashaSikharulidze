                  <p class="word-spacing">During the summer I experienced a lot in many different cities of Germany. While working and studying, I saw many interesting places and did excellent activities that inspired me. This castle here was in Lubeck, which is not enormous but has its history and unique buildings. I spent a few days relaxing and exploring the city, and I was left super satisfied.  I was staying right in the old town, which was mainly the whole city.  </p>

                    <p class="word-spacing">One of the activities I have done while in Germany is stand-up paddling. Long story short, I was a camp counselor, and I had the opportunity to experience many different activities with the kids, and I never missed a chance! I was eager to try surfing since childhood, it did not work out in Germany, but stand-up paddling was also very exciting. Being in the sea paddling around the waves felt terrific. This photo of mine looks cringy, but that is all I have.</p>
